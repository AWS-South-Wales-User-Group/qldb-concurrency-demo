/**
 * A class representing a QLDB transaction.
 *
 * Every transaction is tied to a parent (Pooled)QldbSession, meaning that if the parent session is closed or
 * invalidated, the child transaction is automatically closed and cannot be used. Only one transaction can be active at
 * any given time per parent session, and thus every transaction should call {@linkcode Transaction.abort} or
 * {@linkcode Transaction.commit} when it is no longer needed, or when a new transaction is desired from the parent
 * session.
 *
 * An InvalidSessionException indicates that the parent session is dead, and a new transaction cannot be created
 * without a new (Pooled)QldbSession being created from the parent driver.
 *
 * Any unexpected errors that occur within a transaction should not be retried using the same transaction, as the state
 * of the transaction is now ambiguous.
 *
 * When an OCC conflict occurs, the transaction is closed and must be handled manually by creating a new transaction
 * and re-executing the desired queries.
